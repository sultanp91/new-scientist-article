Live demo:

Preview:

The project is taken from The Odin Project - the goal is to practice CSS layout techniques by recreating this [New Scientist article page](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2286218-ancient-lake-in-marss-gale-crater-may-have-actually-been-a-small-pond/). It is not required to recreate any of the dynamic functionality - only to recreate the look of the page.
