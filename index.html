        A purported ancient lake on Mars may have been far smaller than
        researchers thought. NASA’s Curiosity rover has been exploring Gale
        crater for more than eight years, and while early observations suggested
        the entire crater may once have been filled with water, a new analysis
        implies that it just had a series of ponds instead. Previous analyses of
        data from Curiosity have relied heavily on a measure called the chemical
        index of alteration to determine how rocks were weathered over time.
        Joseph Michalski at the University of Hong Kong and his colleagues have
        suggested that because this measure was developed for use on Earth, it
        may not be valid in the extreme Martian climate. Instead, they analysed
        the concentrations of various compounds that are expected to change
        based on different types of weathering over time. They found that some
        of the layers of rock Curiosity examined did interact with water at some
        point in their past, but more are likely to have formed outside of the
        water. Read more: Microbes burping methane on Mars may be right next to
        NASA rover “Over hundreds of metres of strata, it seems that the only
        layers that are demonstrably lacustrine [formed in a lake] are the lower
        few metres,” says Michalski. “Of the rocks visited by the rover… the
        fraction that is demonstrably lacustrine is something like 1 per cent.”
        These rocks were mostly in the lowest few metres of sediments in the
        crater, suggesting the lake was not nearly as deep or extensive as we
        thought. “There was likely a small lake or more likely a series of small
        lakes in the floor of Gale crater, but these were shallow ponds,” says
        Michalski. The rocks that didn’t form in water appeared to be volcanic,
        so Michalski says that they may have formed out of ash from volcanic
        eruptions after the water in Gale crater had dried up. Observations by
        other Mars missions have hinted that these sediments were deposited by
        wind, not water, so this may solve that mismatch. Journal reference:
